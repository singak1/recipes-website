        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This butter chicken recipe, or <strong>chicken makhani</strong>, is one of my favorite Indian dishes.
        It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. 
        It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne.
        Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.

            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. </li><br>
            <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to stir frequently. </li><br>
            <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside. </li><br>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. </li><br>
            <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together. </li><br>
            <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened. </li><br>
